**Plan name**

`FEATURE_NAME.md`

**Strict instructions:**

1. **One step at a time** (follow the order of the implementation plan).

2. **Code the elements** completed in the current step.
3. **Check the boxes** once the elements of a step are implemented. Never check a step: that is my responsibility.

4. **Document in Tracking**

5. **Do not move to the next step** without explicit validation from me.

**To do:**

1. Implement the **actions** of the step.

3. Update the `.md` file.

4. Wait for explicit validation of the current step.

5. if all steps are completed, review the changes made by indicating, if present, the limitations of the implementation in a few lines
