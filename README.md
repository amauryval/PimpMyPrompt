# Prompt System for Feature Implementation

A structured workflow for planning and implementing features in a clear, organized manner.

## Overview

This system provides two main templates to guide you through feature development:

1. **`1_Setup_the_plan.md`** - Planning phase
2. **`2_start_coding.md`** - Implementation phase

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Setup the Plan (`1_Setup_the_plan.md`)

**Purpose:** Define the feature and create a detailed implementation plan.

**Steps:**

Fill in the prompt with:
   - **Feature to implement:** Brief description of what you want to build (a few lines)
   - **Affected files:** List the files that will be modified or created

And copy paste to the IA input to generate a detailed implementation plan in a new file named `FEATURE_NAME.md` (replace `FEATURE_NAME` with a descriptive name).



### Phase 2: Start Coding (`2_start_coding.md`)

copy paste to the IA input... et voilà!
